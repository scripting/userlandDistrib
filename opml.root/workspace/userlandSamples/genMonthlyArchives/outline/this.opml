I've had to make the kinds of decisions Engelbart faced, quite a few times.

					<outline text="You can still listen to a Rolling Stones or Doors song recorded in the 60s, but there is no current platform that can run Engelbart's Augment system today. That's the difference between this art form and others. We, imho, gratuitously break systems, just so a new generation can re-invent everything the previous generation had already invented.

					<outline text="I had a slogan in my early days programming: Discontinuities suck. I want steady evolution that builds on all past work, and invalidates nothing. Let people continue to develop as they please, even if you don't understand what they're doing. And remember that brilliance does not become obsolete. Engelbart had a twinkle in his eye, even through all the frustation. He wanted to see human intellect soar. Too bad we didn't achieve that with his help, during his lifetime.

					<outline text="The last few years, as Google has come to dominate the RSS market, have been very bad for RSS, imho. I say that because a technology with tremendous potential for decentralizing news flow became one of the Internet's most singularly centralized technologies. We couldn't move in RSS-land because any change had to be implemented by Google. And their only ideas seemed to be how to most efficiently kill RSS, not to improve it, make it work better. As their involvement neared the end, all you would hear from the tech press were gloating cheers that RSS had died. Twitter was the new RSS.

In Chrome, Safari or Firefox there's no way to do it. In this one area apparently Microsoft wins the prize, and all they had to do is not screw with RSS, and let the browser render it as it would any other file.

But I'm a newbie, and if I had spent the last five years developing in it, the last thing I'd want to hear is that the language itself is considered a moving target. So, net-net, we have to insist that for now at least JS stay what it is. I don't trust anything about Google to do this right.

No doubt said with genuine admiration, it exposed something inside that's imho incorrect. He said that it's amazing that I keep writing software, many years after I no longer had to. I imagine when Matt looks at me, he hopes that he will have the drive to create when he's my age (he's about 30 years younger than me). But I'd rather if Matt ignored my age and my financial circumstances, and looked at the actual software I'm writing -- today -- not in the past. I would prefer if he said: I think Dave's new software is interesting, but I don't understand it. Or I think Dave's software is revolutionary and it will have impact on all software being developed today.

We saw that happen &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/swattingAwayFlies&quot;&gt;with the Knicks&lt;/a&gt; this season, when JR Smith, thinking the Knicks had won, celebrated by elbowing an opponent.

					<outline text="As discourse has moved to Twitter, its big contribution has been to push aside the abuse that's common with discussion boards and mail lists. A very simple feature in Twitter, the block command, enforces decorum, by empowering the listener to turn you off if they find you offensive. People learn that if they say abusive things, they don't have to listen. The only people I listen to on Twitter are those who can make a point without getting personal.

					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;This question came up in the Community Feed, which you can read in Fargo, by choosing the Community Feed command from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/10/docsmenu.gif&quot;&gt;Docs menu&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can read it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://reader.smallpicture.com/?opmlurl=http://smallpicture.com/feed.opml&quot;&gt;Small Picture Reader&lt;/a&gt; if you don't use Fargo. I wrote my answer there, but thought it would be interesting to also post it here. No I didn't use the fancy &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/aRenaissanceInBlogging&quot;&gt;Blogging 2.0&lt;/a&gt; protocol I described in an earlier post.

					<outline text="It would take time to write the code and keep it running. It would be worth doing if there would be a lot of people using it. But right now the Community Feed a new feature. We're still at the point where we're introducing ourselves. If that's all it does it will have been worth it."/>
					<outline text="I'm an investor in software, and I have to make decisions as any investor would. I can't buy everything. And right now there are other projects that I think need more attention. "/>
					<outline text="Also, and this is a key point, this is not something you need Kyle or me to do. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallpicture.com/feed.opml&quot;&gt;OPML feed&lt;/a&gt; is public. If you want to write the code to convert it to an RSS feed, you can do it. ">
						<outline text="Read it once every ten minutes. Use the eTag feature of HTTP to conserve bandwidth. Generate RSS 2.0. How will you synthesize a title for each item? I don't know, that's a hard problem. RSS 2.0 doesn't require titles, but Google Reader did. That made generating RSS feeds a difficult process for data that doesn't inherently have titles. But Google Reader is going away, so we're free to do as we please, you say. Not so fast. The replacements are clones. I bet they're just as picky as GR was. At least until the dust settles, and that isn't going to happen this year even, probably. "/>

					<outline text="But OPML feeds? Ahhh that's easy. Since I'm writing both ends I can make it work. And if I want to change things based on what I learn, I can do that too. That's why the early days on anything are important. And why you should go slowly enough so you can feed back what you learn into the protocol. "/>
					<outline text="Anyway you see these questions sound simple, but when you actually start writing the code, they can become complex. "/>

That led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/whatIsARiverOfNews&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/a&gt; a brief email exchange with Brent Simmons about what a river is, from a design standpoint. But there's more to rivers than their form, there are a couple of other very important ways to look at them:" created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:39:45 GMT" pgfnum="23699">
						<outline text="1. &lt;b&gt;Standardization&lt;/b&gt;." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:40:52 GMT" pgfnum="23700">
							<outline text="The Mac beat the IBM PC because there were user interface standards. If I learned how to use a couple of apps, I was actually learning how to use all of them. If your river and my river work and act differently, we have no advantage, and people are going to stay with Twitter, because there, the UI for all rivers is the same. True, it's limited to 140 characters, but the advantages of standardization make Twitter easy and familiar." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:41:22 GMT" pgfnum="23703"/>
							<outline text="It should also be possible for users to combine rivers. I want Reuters and Wired rivers, for example, but I don't want to go to two places to view their news. Again with standards, we don't have to force readers to make a choice. This means growth for the alternate-Twitter, which is the potential of news moving to rivers. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:43:42 GMT" pgfnum="23704"/>
							<outline text="Standardization is something the tech industry has a hard time with. But my experience with news and RSS is that it's not as much of a problem with publishing. Once we had the NYT on board, all the other pubs followed, compatibly, without the usual fighting that happens in tech." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:45:01 GMT" pgfnum="23705">

							<outline text="I offer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; we're using for rivers. It's a simple jQuery template, and an equally simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://riverjs.org/&quot;&gt;JSON format&lt;/a&gt;. The template was designed by an open &lt;a href=&quot;http://beautriver1.blorkmark.com/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; in a Google Group a couple of years ago. I designed the JSON format to help define the problem for the group. It was a wonderfully successful open collaboration. I hope other people just use it as-is.

							<outline text="This part, I believe, will be difficult for news organizations. But, if you want to compete with Twitter, you have to include bloggers in your stream. I don't mean reporters who call themselves bloggers, rather people who have expertise or experience that makes them the kind of people reporters like to quote. People whose ideas you think are dangerous. More of that. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:47:54 GMT" pgfnum="23707"/>

News will never reform itself until it feels the pressure from the sources, where it matters most, on the screens of their readers." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:49:07 GMT" pgfnum="23708"/>
							<outline text="We need to have one environment where professional reporters, sources and critics co-mingle their thoughts. We don't need a Public Editor as much as we need The Public. That's why Twitter has been so popular, but it's unfortunate that the news industry has been unwilling to meet them there. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:50:04 GMT" pgfnum="23709"/>

					<outline text="An outliner is designed for editing structure more than it is for editing text. The text is sort of &quot;along for the ride.&quot; Or you could see an outliner as text-on-rails.

					<outline text="The reason a program has to be either a word processor or an outliner is this: There's only one keyboard, and one set of mouse gestures. The identity of a product is determined by choices made by the designer. Word processors are good at selecting words, sentences and paragraphs. Outliners select headlines and all their subs. Shift-click in the two apps do vastly different things, yet in both cases they are &quot;extending the selection.&quot; Even the data structures used by the programs are different. Yet superficially they look similar. "/>
					<outline text="Some great software designers were fooled by this in the first go-around. Probably the guys who did Word thought at first that they were equalling our outliner, but I guess over time they realized what we learned too. That you need to know what your product is supposed to do before you make those choices. Otherwise it ends up as a confusing unusable mess. That's why Lotus 1-2-3 was a magical product, and Symphony, that confronted this problem head-on and didn't solve it (because it doesn't have a solution) never had 1-2-3's balance and sharp-edge feel.

Most of us feel like we're on the sidelines, spectators, consumers, eyeballs, credit card numbers, and that's not what we want. We want meaning. We want to make a contribution. We want do do good and have that good make a difference. If you look at what people actually do, not the stories you read in the paper or hear on CNN, this is obvious. The bombings not only worried people, for a short time when the scope of the danger was unknown, but people also saw the opportunity to get some of the precious stuff, meaning and relevance.

As long as they view it that way, people will continue to be frustrated by them, as long as they pay any attention. And more and more they're chosing to not pay attention.

					<outline text="3. Fargo is deceptively simple. You edit documents within documents, nesting them and organizing to as many levels as you need. Reorganize structures with a single gesture. Expand to see the detail or zoom out to see the big picture. "/>
					<outline text="4. Dropbox is brilliant and transformative. Coupled with the deep power of Fargo, you get a profoundly powerful work environment that goes everywhere. "/>

The prototypical example of this is a slide show. That's what MORE did so well, why it won all the awards, and caught the attention of the press and investors, Guy Kawasaki and Apple, and a whole boatload of users. So that's where we begin with the plug-in story today. " created="Mon, 01 Apr 2013 17:03:31 GMT" pgfnum="21899"/>

					<outline text="All this is accomplished with OPML, which is an incredible way to package up a structure of text to ship between programs. It's almost a whole language unto itself for specifying the arrangement of text. And as you know, we have an easy editor for producing OPML (the world-famous Little Outliner you've heard so much about). And with all the experimentation that's been done in JavaScript tools for presenting stuff, the outliner is the missing element that makes this stuff truly user-friendly. If you don't believe me, have a look at the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/&quot;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/&quot;&gt;bespoke.js&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored&quot;&gt;impress.js&lt;/a&gt;. All of them produce wonderfully animated presentations, but you have to be a real glutton for tech detail to even begin to create your own.

					<outline text="My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &lt;i&gt;scoped.&lt;/i&gt; When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it.

					<outline text="3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. " created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:28 GMT" pgfnum="21425"/>
					<outline text="4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference." created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:50 GMT" pgfnum="21426"/>
					<outline text="5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable.

					<outline text="6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet.

That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). " created="Fri, 15 Mar 2013 01:39:01 GMT" pgfnum="20432"/>
					<outline text="OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator.

Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try)." created="Fri, 15 Mar 2013 01:40:46 GMT" pgfnum="20433"/>

In NYC, you go for two days, and sit and wait for a trial. Then they herd 75 citizens of New York County into a courtroom and winnow us until there are 14 left -- 12 jurors and two alternates, and the rest go back into the pool. If you make it through two days without being selected, you go home and resume your life. Otherwise you're a juror. But the education process begins the minute you sit down in the waiting room.

					<outline text="It was an eye-opener. The judge had explained a few of important points: 1. The defendent, accused of burglary, is innocent until proven guilty. 2. The standard of proof is high. You had to be certain the person had done what he was accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise -- innocent. 3. The burden of proof is on the state. The defendent can remain silent, and you can't use that fact in coming up with a decision. " created="Fri, 08 Mar 2013 14:22:05 GMT" pgfnum="19923"/>

I don't doubt that for these guys malware didn't make a big difference. Maybe &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was the outlier, maybe not many other people thought it would be nice to take a vacation from fighting the viruses. And then the vaction became permanent.

I bet a lot of them were my age at the time (28), that is, younger than Michael and myself. And they were right to be upset. We called both products ThinkTank.

					<outline text="Margaret Sullivan, the NY Times public editor has a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/conflicting-assertions-over-an-electric-car-test-drive/&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of the dispute, so far.

					<outline text="Some obvious observations." created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:09:10 GMT" pgfnum="18687"/>
					<outline text="1. The whole thing is good for Tesla. I hadn't seen the original review, but after seeing Musk's initial review-of-the-review, I became interested. Someday I might buy a Tesla as a result of the increased interest. It'll take a number of events like this to get me to buy, but a car is a big purchase, so it seems it should take a lot of work to close the deal. " created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:09:52 GMT" pgfnum="18688"/>
					<outline text="2. Before this, the most memorable thing I had heard about the Tesla was from Evan Williams who said it was the iPhone of cars. That made sense to me, and Williams saying it made a difference. I believe he understands what makes an iPhone nice. And cars are not designed like iPhones, but it might be nice if they were. :-)" created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:11:06 GMT" pgfnum="18689"/>
					<outline text="3. Had it been any publication other than the Times, they wouldn't have had Margaret Sullivan to rep the news side of it. This is possibly a big deal. I have been impressed with Ms Sullvivan's work so far, after being very irritated by her predecessors. They didn't seem to rep the public. Mostly they explained why the Times insiders were right all along and the public was wrong. " created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:11:46 GMT" pgfnum="18690"/>
					<outline text="4. Even though I'm a fan, I think public editors should be from the public, not journalism. And a publication of the stature of the Times should have many of them. The rule is they could put something on the Times website, adjacent to the articles they're commenting on, and they could say whatever they need to say to create balance. They wouldn't have indefinite terms, and it would be possible to fire them, but only if they breached ethical standards themselves. " created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:13:21 GMT" pgfnum="18691">
						<outline text="Some stories need lots of public editors, and maybe the public editors should be given anonymity. An example is the run-up to the war in Iraq when all the publications carried the same wrong story. Another, more recent example is the telling of the life story of Aaron Swartz. I knew Aaron, and I read many of the stories, shaking my head at the awful reporting. You can forgive Aaron's friends for distorting the truth, perhaps -- they were grieving. But what were the reporters' excuses? If they were emotionally tied to the story they should have been excused. The purpose of a news publication is to tell the truth, especially if it's unpopular. The Times  has a public editor because it wasn't living up to this ideal, and they knew it, and presumably wanted to do something to fix it. But it's too big a job for just one person.

					<outline text="5. All pubs should have someone like Ms Sullivan. Over the years, I've had a number of disputes that cut to the integrity of reporters at major publications, like the one Mr Musk has with the Times. None of them have had public editors, and none of them ever resolved the issue one way or the other. One even threatened to sue me for libel if I didn't stop saying they were doing something wrong (a British publication). Imagine if a software company threatened every user who reported a bug. I told them to go ahead. At least it would have raised the issue in a way they would have had to respond to." created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:15:10 GMT" pgfnum="18692"/>
					<outline text="6. Just like all software has bugs, all publications have breaches of integrity. The question isn't whether or not you have them, you do. The question is what you do when someone raises an issue." created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:18:15 GMT" pgfnum="18693"/>
					<outline text="7. I've long felt that each blogger who values his or her reputiation should have a panel of &quot;rabbis&quot; who will respond to public integrity challenges. If my rabbis say I have to address a certain issue, then I will. If they say it's not an issue, I can go about my business without responding. This would do a lot to increase confidence, and also protect us from troll-like accusations. I think it's possible the same system could work for publications too. Sort of a shared public editor function, for organizations that don't have the resources to hire one of their own." created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:18:51 GMT" pgfnum="18694"/>
					<outline text="8. It's possible that Musk is a troll. It's also possible that Broder made it up. I don't expect Sullivan to say either of these things unless it's so obvious as to be indisputable. And it won't be. She will tell us what both sides say and will look at the data herself. She'll look at what others say, and will suggest that while Musk has a fine product he has probably engaged in a little self-promotion here. And that the Times can and should have some new policy for testing cars. We will get a decent list of sources to examine ourselves, and we will, as always, make up our own minds.

					<outline text="3. This is a theme of modern media. It's why Napster was such a breakthrough. All of a sudden instead of being programmed, I could do the programming myself. Same thing with the travel industry, vacation rentals, retail, love -- everything. By now the pattern should be obvious to everyone. The users do the programming now. It creates new interest in, and demand for, creativity. THe fear of the entertainment industry was a fear of change. There was never a reason to be scared of irrelevance. Creativity is more in demand now that it ever was. " created="Tue, 05 Feb 2013 18:03:14 GMT" pgfnum="18273"/>

The result was House of Cards. Exactly on the terms that the users have been demanding since Napster. Entertain us, but we want to do the programming ourselves.

					<outline text="9. When you do that, you'll see very clearly that what the news industry needs is a cooperative venture that's external to all the news orgs, as Hulu was to the entertainment divisions of the networks, and boot up a new distribution system. Twitter and Facebook have shown you how to do it, although it wasn't necessary to wait this long -- you've now waited long enough. The new system will look like Twitter. You have to be present everywhere your news is in demand. The news industry should have a system tailored to the realities of news, the way Netflix has moved to become the HBO of the Internet age.

I wrote about this in an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/ifTheNytHadCojones&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, where I suggested the NYT do this. I did not mean to say that they should publish the bloggers in the paper or on its website. Just house them on premises. I'm thinking about serendipity. Overhearing elevator conversations.

At 88 he had become frail. Now come the memorials. Let's hope they don't lose their perspective. Ed Koch was no saint. He had a sharp tongue, and over his many years in public life he made many enemies. But he was also much loved in NY. Before Koch, the city was drifting in a post-Robert Moses funk. It was dirty and unsafe and in many ways just didn't work. Koch did much to turn the city around. And he didn't apologize for being a New Yorker. When he asked &quot;How am I doing?&quot; don't think it wasn't with much irony. What could &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; stop a New Yorker from telling you how you're doing. And it's not usually going to come with a hug or a pat on the back, although Koch was the exception, on the boardwalk in Coney Island or in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/edward-i-koch-ex-mayor-of-new-york-dies.html&quot;&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; under Manhattan, people told him to keep up the good work. We appreciated what he was doing for the city. NY is and was and always will be a tough place, on a personal level. But it's a place of symbols. Koch was us, and the reflection wasn't so bad. We have a sense of humor, a sense of what-the-fuck. Somehow we'll get through this, and a feeling that it can be better if we work together, dammit.

There are many other examples of seminal software products. In most cases, the products are not the first of its kind, as MacWrite was not the first word processor, but for whatever reason, put enough of the pieces together to lead the way to the future.

People believed that (not Woz, he's always been a visionary and an inclusionist, the movie did him a disservice). To be a believer meant being lonely. That is, until we all read Ted Nelson's book! So, if we were to make a list of art that led to the popular use of computers, Nelson's work would surely be in there. As would Woz and Jobs, and Bill Atkinson, Randy Wiggington and Susan Kare, who pioneered a little thing like graphic icons.

					<outline text="And Unix, sparse, bare-bones and character-based was also hugely influential. In the commercial software world it lay dormant during the 80s, mostly used in academia. But the seed was planted. If you got a compsci education in the late 70s or 80s you used Unix. And then, in the early 90s when networking boomed, it was Unix it boomed around. It became the server platform. The web basically is Unix with a somewhat friendly interface slapped on it (said with a bit of irony). I never thought users would tolerate &lt;i&gt;http://&lt;/i&gt; but it shows how wrong you can be (an idea always worth considering)." created="Sat, 26 Jan 2013 13:43:12 GMT" pgfnum="17702"/>

					<outline text="I get a fair amount of grief for writing my blog and pushing links through my feed and to Twitter. It's been this way since before I started blogging. There are always people around who question your motives, and who project their own nasty theories about people on the easiest target to find.

It's a rule I don't have any trouble keeping, even though at the beginning, it was like a New Years resolution, it felt like a chore.

Because whether you're honest or not is something for you to deal with, and if there is a god, for he or she to judge you on. It's not my problem, thankfully.

If they say it's something I should pay attention to, I would -- but they never do. The most recent time it happened, a friend came back and said the person is a sadist. But my mind still circles around the abuse. I have a hard time not thinking about it. So what do I do? Write about it, of course.

I remember being at a conference, chatting with someone and I saw at the other end of the room someone who had been a friend but had started trashing me on the Internet. I excused myself and walked over to the guy and sat down next to him, and asked why he was doing it. He started repeating the nonsense he was saying online. But I didn't think he really believed it, so I pressed him and asked why he was &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; doing it. He said he had cancer, and was in chemo, and was in a lot of pain. I felt sick myself in that moment. I said you know that's terrible, but it's no reason to do and say things that hurt me, and make me feel bad. We all have our struggles. Me too. He agreed, and we're friends again, but now when I see him online, I can't forget how &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; I was, and why, and the pain comes back, his pain and mine. This really sucks.

						<outline text="&quot;When I was a kid, I thought a lot about what made me different from the other kids. I don't think I was smarter than them and I certainly wasn't more talented. And I definitely can't claim I was a harder worker -- I've never worked particularly hard, I've always just tried doing things I find fun. Instead, what I concluded was that I was more curious -- but not because I had been born that way. If you watch little kids, they are intensely curious, always exploring and trying to figure out how things work. The problem is that school drives all that curiosity out. Instead of letting you explore things for yourself, it tells you that you have to read these particular books and answer these particular questions. And if you try to do something else instead, you'll get in trouble. Very few people's curiosity can survive that. But, due to some accident, mine did. I kept being curious and just followed my curiosity.&quot;"/>

Everyone has a different process, and it could be different every time depending on who-knows-what. Death is something that I find impossible to understand. That's why it's so damned frightening. Maybe it's no more unpleasant than taking a trip. Maybe god is merciful and death is a pleasurable release full of spritual oxytocin. There are reasons to believe this might be so. Maybe death is something that's impossible to experience, much as we have no memory of existence from before conception? Death is a mystery, a horrifying one, if you love life.

Blogging isn't always an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur&quot;&gt;amateur&lt;/a&gt; thing, even though I strongly associate the word with the deed. Amateur means it's done for love, not money. Good blogging &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; amateur. But then so is good everything, pretty much. I don't really care how much money you made writing that book or movie script. I care about what it evoked for me, what you said, what it proved. On those grounds Nate Silver certainly belongs in the BOTY seat for this year. He proved that an individual with his brain and beliefs can conquer all the paid pundits the pros can muster. Politically and spiritually Nate is a carrier of The Cause. Believe your eyes and ears, and your mind, not conventional wisdom. But in the end, I believe his accomplishments in 2012 were not about his blogging. The blogging was a means to a different end. If there's an award for statistical modeler of the year, that award should go to Nate, without contest." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2012 15:35:53 GMT" pgfnum="16361"/>

					<outline text="The last week I've been helping my very good friend NakedJen get started in the world of smartphones. Until now she had a Blackberry that could do SMS, but had email disabled. I don't really understand why, but it's not important to the story. She was hard to reach via email, and she couldn't use any of the apps we all like to use. She didn't have maps or any of the other cool stuff we're all playing with these days." created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:38:42 GMT" pgfnum="15842"/>

					<outline text="I think she stayed up all night playing with the phone. When I checked in with her, she had done all kinds of customizations. The next day she was installing apps. She was giggling with glee at every revelation. I think she saw that this mode of computer use is actually pretty simple. And she's taking it back with her to Salt Lake City, where her family there will be very happy I'm sure that Jen will be part of the 21st Century (something I like to kid her about)." created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:41:42 GMT" pgfnum="15844"/>
					<outline text="Next part of the story. This morning I got a Fedex from a longtime friend at Microsoft. In the package there were two new smartphones, a Nokia 920 and 810. Since I am a T-Mobile guy, I started with the 810. It's a lovely piece of tech. The performance and color are amazing. It's also very easy to guess where everything is. I had it set up to work over wifi with my GMail account in about five minutes. A few minutes later I was taking pictures and had installed the Twitter app. I sent a text message. Then we went out for a walk. I took my iPod Touch, iPad LTE and Nexus 4 with me, in addition to the 810, and of course NakedJen and her Android phone. It all worked just fine. Everything that didn't have its own service plan connected to the net via Bluetooth through the iPad. " created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:43:38 GMT" pgfnum="15845"/>

I can't even figure out how to send an SMS without someone sending me one first. I tried reading all of Google's docs, installed all the software they told me to install, and in the end I went back to the Nexus 4 to communicate with Jen. Later I realized I could do what I needed to with the Voice website. But there were problems there too. I ended up having to enter the number manually, my contacts list was useless in that context.

Technically they're not right about this. Creating a new blog is no more complex than creating a new word processing document. But there's a psychic overhead that stops a lot of people.

Zeldman kind of got tripped up by this, but Williams was very clear. Users can create new buckets or collections and call them anything they want. A bucket is analogous to a blog post. Then other people can post to it. That's like a comment. But it doesn't look like a comment. It's got a place for a big image at the top. It looks much prettier than a comment, and much bigger.

Also not clear is how much portability users will have. At this point they offer beta users a way to download the contents of their site. This doesn't make it possible to use it as an editorial system for other environments, or the other way around, to use other tools to author content for Medium. There's no doubt Ev understands the opportunities here. Blogger had a pretty complete API as did Twitter. But in Twitter, everyone got burned by the API, including the company (though to a much lesser extent than developers) so my guess is that Ev's new company will be more conservative about interfaces than his previous ventures." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:22:56 GMT" pgfnum="15614"/>

					<outline text="He's right! I said what the problems are, but I didn't offer ways to help. This is equally important. So here's a list of things you can do to help." created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:17:59 GMT" pgfnum="15552">
						<outline text="1. Don't write mini-essays in Twitter. Instead fully express your idea on your blog and post a link to Twitter. That's the single most constructive thing people can do. "/>
						<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/20/lego.gif&quot; width=&quot;125&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named lego.gif&quot;&gt;2. If you absolutely can't respond in a post, then respond in a comment. 140 character posts are very often impossible to parse. And are hard to respond to if my answer requires more than 140. That's why I don't do support on Twitter. I think it's impossible. And tweets have limited utility after they scroll off. Comments create a somewhat better record. And instead of concentrating everything on one company's servers, we can spread them around a little." collapse="true">
							<outline text="That said, don't see this rule as requiring you to be long-winded. You still want to get to the point quickly so people read what you're saying. People are very busy these days, so you want to say what you have to say as quickly as possible. And if you have a blogging tool that supports collapsable text like mine, use it to add detail in a way that's optional for the reader. " created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:29:49 GMT" pgfnum="15558"/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="3. For the installed leaders -- run a river of the blogs you read, and share it with your readers. Link to it prominently from your home page. Talk about it in posts. Get people to read more than just your blog. " collapse="true">
							<outline text="Someone asked for an example of a river. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&quot;&gt;Here you go&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:31:28 GMT" pgfnum="15559"/>
							<outline text="A river is the next thing after a blogroll."/>
							<outline text="A blogroll just has pointers to blogs. A river includes their stories."/>
							<outline text="It's a way of defining a community. It's one of those wonderful things that empowers the river-owner and the people whose content flows through the river. "/>
							<outline text="Someday not only will every publication have a river, but they will be defined by their river. "/>
							<outline text="We need to get one editorial organization to do it and do it right."/>
							<outline text="BTW, people note that my river is mostly mainstream pubs. That's because bloggers are publishing so little these days. I subscribe to lots of blogs. But they aren't updating. Let's fix that!" created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:36:46 GMT" pgfnum="15562"/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="4. Also do the thing that the &quot;big boys&quot; do so well -- reference each other. If I write something that you find interesting, write a blog post about it, and link to my post. "/>
						<outline text="5. Don't wait for a press release to write about something that's new. I find it amazing sometimes all the new stuff I've shipped on Scripting News, whci now is a fairly radical-looking blog with at least a few never-seen-before features, yet, as far as I know -- no one has written about them. Why? They say that news is just regurgitated press releases. This seems to confirm it." created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:22:13 GMT" pgfnum="15554"/>
						<outline text="6. Fight conventional wisdom. One of the reasons blogs started in the first place was to fight the CW that there was no new Mac software. All the reporters knew this wasn't true, but they reported the CW that there wasn't. Reporters still do this. So let's route around that. The great &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Nisker&quot;&gt;Scoop Nisker&lt;/a&gt; said -- If you don't like the news, go out and make some of your own. A very wise man. :-)" created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:23:42 GMT" pgfnum="15555"/>
						<outline text="7. Share your ideas and observations. Start new threads that aren't responsive to anyone else. If you have an epiphany or see something you don't think anyone else has seen -- that's a blog post. Write it up!" created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:25:05 GMT" pgfnum="15556"/>
						<outline text="8. If you're a developer, hook your favorite tweet-like system up to RSS, both ways. I want to be able to hook my &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog feed&lt;/a&gt; up to everything. This is how we bootstrap a network of compatible twitter-like systems. Use an existing standard that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/magazine/17-09/ff_goodenough?currentPage=all&quot;&gt;good enough&lt;/a&gt; to hook everything up to everything.

					<outline text="Here's the list of problems." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:39:23 GMT" pgfnum="15338"/>
					<outline text="1. I already had a great iPad. It's big and heavy, and hurts my arm to read in bed. It's my primary bed computer, and also the second screen when I'm watching TV. When I read in bed it leaves impressions on my arm where it rests. I can't imagine this is good for the circulation in my arm. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:39:34 GMT" pgfnum="15339"/>
					<outline text="2. I could use the iPad Mini, but I don't. People say they don't mind the grainier screen, but I do. If I have a choice, and I do, I always pick up the bigger iPad with the easy-to-read high resolution screen." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:40:25 GMT" pgfnum="15340"/>
					<outline text="3. What about as a traveling computer? Well, there too I go for the larger iPad, because it has LTE. It's very functional, in my knapsack, when I go out. I swtich it over from wifi to LTE when I go out. And I turn on Bluetooth, so that my iPod (blue, 32GB) has a way to get on the net. The iPad Mini could be a replacement for the iPod, I suppose. But it doesn't fit in the pocket as well. (However it does fit in my pocket, which is cool. Maybe I should try replacing the iPod with the Mini.)" created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:40:57 GMT" pgfnum="15341"/>
					<outline text="4. But here's the verdict, the reason why I think this product is making Apple's stock dive. Steve never would have shipped it. I know people have been saying that about all kinds of things ever since he died. Steve wouldn't have done this or that. I've stayed away from saying that -- even though the thought has popped into my head -- because I've never felt certain, and I don't think it's fair to say something like that unless you really feel it in your gut. But this one is kind of obvious. Technology has to keep getting better. Once you've shipped an iPad with a super high-resolution &quot;retina&quot; display, you can't ask people to buy a new one that doesn't have it. Steve wouldn't have done it. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:42:35 GMT" pgfnum="15342"/>
					<outline text="5. Some features are just features, like a camera, but the resolution of a display isn't a feature. It's integral to the product. It's like trying to sell a car with a fuzzy windshield. Everything you do with the Mini is a reminder that you could be using a nicer product. Always having the nicest thing is what Steve's Apple stood for. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:59:23 GMT" pgfnum="15344"/>
					<outline text="6. The new Apple is willing to compromise. And what are they compromising for? Well, it looks like they're doing it so they can &quot;compete&quot; with Google and Amazon. But again -- Steve's Apple never deigned to do something as crass as &quot;competing.&quot; It was a foreign concept. Steve's Apple was so far in advance of everyone else, it was ridiculous to think of them as competition. But here is the new Apple inviting comparison to something else. But the comparison that's inevitable and damning, is the comparison between the Mini and its predecessor, the iPad 3. And in that comparison the newer product is a dust-catcher. Its battery is always fully charged. It never gets off the night table. It was an obsolete product the day it shipped, and the day &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it shipped. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:59:51 GMT" pgfnum="15345"/>
					<outline text="BTW, this is why the orchestrated reviews of products are often worthless. I invite Mossberg, Pogue or Gruber to re-review their iPad Mini now, a week after their initial reviews, and let us know if they're actually using it. And if they still think it's a winner. I believe it's not only not a winner, but it signals a new Apple that's no longer beyond compare, no longer insisting on delighting its users to the point of orgasm. This Apple is content to be a competitor. Not my idea of what Apple is, and definitely not Steve's. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:48:33 GMT" pgfnum="15343"/>

That would have changed the tone of the campaign. But this isn't the kind of thing a Romney does. And that's a big part of why he isn't President-elect Romney.

I am educated, with a math degree. I've spent decades writing software. To do what I do requires a precise kind of thinking, but there's also an art to it. So when I read Nate's analysis, I recognize and appreciate it. I think Nate is one of a small number of young folk who make me optimistic about the future. I appreciate that he uses statistical methods, and I understand what you can and cannot do with stats. It's possible that Romney will win when there's an 80 percent chance of Obama winning. But, according to Nate's model, four times out of five, Obama wins. He's not 100 percent sure of it. But he's sure enough to put his honor on the line. As a believer in Nate, and a supporter of Obama, I am relieved. But -- if Nate said it was the other way around, 80 percent likely that Romney would win, I wouldn't even think of trying to discredit Nate. Instead, I'd be depressed about the future of the world.

I was saying &quot;Sources Go Direct.&quot; I wasn't saying that I &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; sources to go direct, or that editors deserved to be routed around (although as a matter of fact I did, and mostly do). But that wasn't what I was saying. I was saying that if you're in the publishing business, in any way, you have to realize that the lower cost of production and distribution has radically changed the way things work. You must factor that in. Hating me won't change anything. And if you actually listen to what I'm saying (there's the rub again) I say over and over that I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; professional journalists to make the transition. But you can't make the transition by clinging to a system that has gone away." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:42:16 GMT" pgfnum="14652"/>
					<outline text="6. Another clue is that the topic is something that you find repulsive. Most people can't listen to topics that disgust them. For example, if I say that the OWS people missed huge opportunities because they didn't listen, if you support OWS, you're going to likely respond with a story that's orthogonal. I know this because it happens every time. But isn't it better to hear about the missed opportunity, esp when it's not too late, because then you don't have to miss it? To me, this is like a programmer who argues with a bug report. Why? If you listen, you can fix it. Good programmers do not argue with bug reports. And good revolutionaries are always looking for ways to be more effective at revolution. Dilbert-like revolutionaries insist on telling you why you don't get it.

Yet, if I look back at my career, much of it right here in the Valley, it seems something would have been lost. Which is how I feel about my contributions now. Lots of missed opportunities.

But, we figured that maybe they'd see how interesting this project is and let it keep running. We're not trying to steal anything from them.

					<outline text="In school they taught us to outline first, then write from the outline. It's an ideal no one achieves, because it's impossible to have the essay arrive in finished form in our mind before we start writing. It doesn't work that way." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 14:14:24 GMT" pgfnum="13859"/>
					<outline text="Instead we wrote the paper first, then the outline." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 14:14:43 GMT" pgfnum="13860"/>
					<outline text="And that was correct, because it was the only way that worked. But it didn't get us much more than a slide show presentation of our work. It's different when you have a structure editor, an outliner. Because you can revise both the text and its organization after the initial burst of writing." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 14:29:06 GMT" pgfnum="13871"/>
					<outline text="Here's how I do it today, in my outliner. I write from top to bottom. Then I review. If I find structure, I add it." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 14:16:11 GMT" pgfnum="13863"/>
					<outline text="Then I have a structure to work with, I add more ideas become apparent, more things I have to record, to tell the reader. The order might change. The process of each little project is to iterate both the work product and the narration until I feel I'm ready to move on to the next thing. " created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 14:16:29 GMT" pgfnum="13864"/>
					<outline text="Of course I might start two or more things at the same time.

					<outline text="But worknotes offer different things to different people. I write them for today's users and hopefully tomorrow's too. But I also write them for developers, including myself, who will continue to work on the code behind the notes. I find it very useful to be able to open my notes from a previous project, while working on something related, and find it all neatly organized, so I can skip right to the part that's relevent to me.

					<outline text="It's still true, but I don't do it in an academic context.

" created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 13:16:45 GMT" pgfnum="13833"/>
					<outline text="And there's nothing wrong with that. In some sense, I did that too -- when I was younger. I thought making millions was the way to get validation for my work. My family and the society I grew up in raised me to see things that way. And I was successful, and as a result have been able to work on what I wanted to for my whole career. Pretty good." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 13:17:37 GMT" pgfnum="13834"/>
					<outline text="Now it's time to take what I've learned and pass it on. There's a huge base of software, most of it open source, that reflects what I've learned. Not just as ideas, but as working code. And programming practices that are, imho, pretty far in advance of what's being done elsewhere. The only problem is, I'm not attracting the students I need to help build something substantial and long-lasting out of it." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 13:18:32 GMT" pgfnum="13835"/>

Now I realize that I don't need the institution as much as I need the students. And I can't work with beginning programmers. I'm looking for people who have spend at least a few years learning the basics, stumbling, falling and getting up again. What I have to offer is the equivalent of an actor's studio, for people with extreme talent and drive, to be creative making software. You might get rich from what you learn, but that shouldn't be the point. " created="Mon, 08 Oct 2012 13:19:39 GMT" pgfnum="13836"/>

Not looking for advice or &quot;solutions&quot; -- but if you have a compatible goal, I'd welcome hearing from you. Not guaranteeing anything, but I will listen.

And once I had enough money to own my own time, it dropped a lot as a priority. I love what I do, but the financial guys mock my love. I've seen them do it over and over, for decades.

But I don't think they're doing that. Because they've made a trade-off.

So we elected someone who would &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; commit the sins of Johnson and Nixon. It was the right choice for 1976.

There's a commenting period where each participant can write a rebuttal, again in private. They're revealed all at once. And that's it. The goal is to cover all sides of a topic, intelligently and not personally. Not surprising this was developed at a law school, by lawyers.

They score points for not turning over tweets to governments, but they have an awful track record of tiliting the playing field to favor their partners and even personal friends. This is a very sloppily run platform for both development and journalism.

There are other free services that don't have such limits. For example, Dropbox. We should all be working together to be sure that valuble historic documents like this are adequately preserved.

					<outline text="1. Jury duty is amazing. Especially if you go all the way to a verdict. You learn how the architecture of our democracy places its faith in the people. You might think, if you listened to some of our political leaders, that this would be a bad idea. Because most of us are takers not makers. But it works, because people are a lot smarter, honest and hard-working than we give ourselves credit for. And when you trust people, when you really make that point, and the legal process does that, over and over, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; comes through. Some people accept trust faster than others, but in the end, all twelve jurors accept their responsibility. When we passed judgement I was sure we had arrived at the correct decision." created="Tue, 18 Sep 2012 12:11:24 GMT" pgfnum="12879">

					<outline text="3. So nothing was actually revealed about Mitt Romney in yesterday's tapes. If you had been watching this guy, like a juror watches every actor in the courtroom, you recognized the pattern. He might have been the guy who runs a company you once worked for. The principal of your school. Your friend's grandfather. To me, he was a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was the kind of guy who doesn't know what it means to speak the truth. His existence has nothing to do with the truth. He's a goal-oriented person. He's trying to get something from you. He doesn't care what he has to say to get it. Since he's running for President, a lot of the times that means he's out of his element and you can tell. He's not comfortable with teachers, with working people. But speaking to the rich donors in that dining room, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; his element. He was comfortable. The same way the defendent in our DUI case would have been comfortable in a bar slamming down a few whiskies before going for a drive.

If you had a little faith in it, if 25 percent more people had more faith, it would work a lot better than you have imagined. Because given enough time, no matter how much they lie, we figure it out.
